This repository contains a MATLAB function that demonstrates a common yet often overlooked error: division by zero. The `bug.m` file shows the faulty code and `bugSolution.m` provides the corrected version, along with explanations to help understand the problem and its solution. The primary issue lies within the nested function `someCalculation`. This example highlights the importance of robust error handling in MATLAB to prevent unexpected application crashes and data corruption.
